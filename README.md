# DFTSW (Density Functional Theory code of Southwest) code

Welcome to the github page of the UTEP electronic structure research group.

This repository (dftsw_readme) is for information purpose only. The source code is hosted on a separate repository. 

## DFTSW version 0.1

This is DFTSW code - Density Functional Theory in SouthWest (El Paso). It evolved from the UTEP-NRLMOL code but all routines such as one electron integrals, overlap integrals, Coulomb integrals, HF integral, Fock matrix construction, Becke mesh etc. have been written from scratch for angular momentum upto h. 
It however maintains the code intializations and file names and outputs same as UTEP-NRLMOL for comptability reasons.
The code development team is 
Carlos Diaz, Luis Basurto, Yoh Yamamoto, Po-Hao Chang,  Selim Romero, Zachhary Buschmann,Tunna Baruah and Rajendra R. Zope.                                  
Some details of code and its parallelization can be found in the theses of Carlos Diaz, Zacchary Buschmann and Luis Basurto.
